## Self-Hosting Guide

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- A domain name (optional, but recommended for production)

### Quick Start

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secure-random-string  # Generate this securely
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:4000         # Change to your domain in production
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:4000`

### Default Login Credentials

- Username: admin
- Password: password123

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Change the default password after first login in production!

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, make sure to:

1. Generate a secure random string for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

2. Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your domain:
   ```env
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
   ```

3. Set up SSL/TLS using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Traefik) for HTTPS.

4. Configure proper firewall rules to only expose port 4000.

### Updating the Application

To update to the latest version:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker compose pull

# Restart the containers
docker compose up -d
```

### Monitoring

Check application status:
```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Check container status
docker compose ps
```

### Backup

The application is stateless, but make sure to backup your `.env` file and any custom configurations.

## Development
